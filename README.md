## Quick Install

    brew tap MuntasirMalek/newkap
    brew install --cask newkap

Automatically installs the right version for your Mac (Intel or Apple Silicon).

## Uninstall (clean, removes all app data)

    brew uninstall --zap --cask newkap

## Quick Record Shortcut (Karabiner Elements)

If you use [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), you can add a **Hyper+R** (Hyper Meaning - https://github.com/MuntasirMalek/setup/blob/main/karabiner.json) shortcut to instantly record your entire screen:

Add this rule to your `karabiner.json` under `complex_modifications > rules`:

```json
{
  "description": "Hyper+R: Record (if closed) / Quit (if open)",
  "manipulators": [
    {
      "from": {
        "key_code": "r",
        "modifiers": {
          "mandatory": ["left_shift", "left_command", "left_control", "left_option"]
        }
      },
      "to": [
        {
          "shell_command": "if pgrep -x NewKap > /dev/null; then osascript -e 'quit app \"NewKap\"'; else open 'kap://record'; fi"
        }
      ],
      "type": "basic"
    }
  ]
}
```

**How it works:**
- **App closed** → Opens NewKap and instantly starts full-screen recording (no cropper UI)
- **App open** → Quits NewKap (stops recording and opens editor if recording was active)

> **Tip:** NewKap also supports deep links: `kap://record` (start recording) and `kap://stop` (stop recording). You can use these from any automation tool.

## Why NewKap?

[Kap](https://github.com/wulkano/Kap) is an amazing open-source screen recorder, but it has not been actively maintained since 2022. The last release (v3.6.0) has critical bugs on macOS Sonoma and Sequoia, with 30+ open issues and 13 unmerged PRs sitting in the original repo.

**NewKap** is a community-driven continuation, like Neovim is to Vim. Our goals:

- Fix what is broken: macOS Sonoma/Sequoia compatibility, recording failures, app hangs
- Community-owned: no single point of failure; the community drives development
- Democratic governance: contributors vote on changes via GitHub Discussions
- Regular releases: if it is fixed, ship it

## What is Fixed (v4.0.0)

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Could not start recording within 5 seconds | Increased timeout to 30s with automatic retry |
| App will not quit / hangs on close | Proper async cleanup with 5s force-quit fallback |
| App startup is slow / hangs | Non-blocking plugin upgrade and update checks |
| Screen capture permission crash on Sonoma | Safe-load fallback for native permission module |
| System Preferences links broken | Updated to System Settings for Sonoma/Sequoia |
| Audio device crashes | Device caching with graceful error fallback |
| Unhandled promise rejections | Expanded error handling throughout the app |
| Recording history cleanup crash | Safe per-file deletion with existence checks |

## Install

Download the latest .dmg from [Releases](https://github.com/MuntasirMalek/NewKap/releases):

- **Intel Mac**: NewKap-4.0.12-x64.dmg
- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)**: NewKap-4.0.12-arm64.dmg

### First Launch (unsigned build)

Since NewKap is not yet notarized with Apple, macOS may show an **"app is damaged"** warning or block the app on first launch. To fix this, run the following after dragging NewKap to your Applications folder:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/NewKap.app
```

Then:

1. Right-click the app and select Open (not double-click)
2. Click Open in the security dialog
3. Grant Screen Recording permission in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording
